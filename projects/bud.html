        <h1>Book of Legendary Parties of Ukraine.</h1>
        <p>The American brand Bud decided to declare itself to the Ukrainian market for the first time. Its main value is to be a part of culture. But for Ukrainians it is just beer without a history. Therefore, we decided to pay respect to the culture that has already formed, but is also in the shadows. In this way, we will make history and become a part of culture not in words, but in deeds.</p>
        <p> </p>
        
        <p>That's why we made a book of Legendary Parties of Ukraine, where the last chapter was the BUD party where we celebrated the creation of this book.</p>
